# 📖 Overview

Water pollution and pipeline leakages remain two of the biggest challenges in modern water distribution systems.

Traditional systems rely heavily on manual inspections, periodic maintenance schedules, and reactive repairs, leading to:

- Huge water losses
- Delayed leak detection
- Infrastructure damage
- Unsafe drinking water
- High maintenance costs

**Vesla** solves these challenges using IoT sensors, cloud computing, and Machine Learning to continuously monitor water quality, detect pipeline leaks in real time, and predict future maintenance requirements before failures occur.

Instead of simply notifying users after something goes wrong, Vesla helps prevent failures before they happen.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Current water management systems suffer from:

- 🚰 Undetected pipeline leakages
- 🌊 Water contamination
- 🔧 Reactive maintenance
- ⏳ Manual inspection
- 💸 High operational costs
- 📉 No predictive analysis

These issues reduce infrastructure lifespan and waste millions of liters of water every year.

---

# 💡 Solution

Vesla continuously monitors:

- 💧 pH
- 💧 Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)
- 💧 Turbidity
- 💧 Pipeline Pressure

Sensor data is transmitted to a cloud backend where it is:

- Stored
- Visualized
- Analyzed
- Used for Machine Learning predictions

The system predicts:

- Future water quality
- Leak probability
- Pipeline degradation
- Tank cleaning schedules
- Preventive maintenance dates

# 🧠 Machine Learning Module

Unlike conventional monitoring systems, Vesla includes an AI engine that continuously analyzes historical sensor data.

The ML model predicts:

✔ Water Quality Forecast

✔ Pipeline Health

✔ Leak Probability

✔ Infrastructure Degradation

✔ Tank Cleaning Recommendation

✔ Maintenance Schedule

This allows authorities to perform **condition-based maintenance** rather than fixed periodic servicing.
